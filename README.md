# Trip Manager Server

This is a simple Node.js application server to manage trips. It is just for demo purposes, built using 
the loopback. It allows to:

* create an account and log in
* when logged in, user can see, edit and delete trips he entered
* it has three types of user roles with different permission levels 
  * regular user is able to CRUD on his owned records, 
  * a user manager is able to CRUD users,
  * an admin is able to CRUD on all records and users
* when a trip is entered, it has Destination, StartDate, EndDate, Comment
* when displayed, each entry has also day count to trip start (only for future trips)
* user can filter trips
* print travel plan for next month in a pdf


This ios app that uses the API is available [here](https://github.com/sanandrea/TripManager)

Tests for the rest API are written in python using `requests` library

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
